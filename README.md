# WiFiKeyboard

This project is in progress. Not ready yet to be tested.

Using STM32F401 Development Board as a USB host to read a wired keyboard and then stream this data wirelessly via tcp connection to a python script emulating a keyboard.
There is a web server containing this script. The keyboard has a display specifying the IP address, so you can easilly find it from your web browser.
